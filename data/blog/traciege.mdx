## This is a WIP project

![traciege-console](/static/images/traciege/traciege-console.png)

## What it does:

It automatically sends you email every day about your siege stats (if any).

## Some available APIs:

- `143.198.210.184:8964/status` check whether it is up and running

- `143.198.210.184:8964/register?name=yourgamertag&email=youremail&platform=uplayorxblorpsn` subscribe and get daily email updates

- `143.198.210.184:8964/dereg` same query params, not finished yet

### TODO:

#### frontend:

- [ ] write docs
- [x] open for registration, post reg info to backend api

#### backend:

- [ ] validation when register
- [ ] store by email rather than id
- [ ] business logic: check daily update
